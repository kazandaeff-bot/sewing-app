Task: Fix customer creation validation error

Work Log:
- Analyzed screenshot: error was "Ошибка валидации" when creating customer
- Found root cause: Zod schema used `.optional()` but UI sent `null` for empty fields. Zod `.optional()` allows `undefined` but NOT `null`
- Fixed `CreateCustomerSchema`: all optional string fields now use `.nullable().optional()`
- Moved INN/KPP/BIK validation from `.refine()` to `.superRefine()` for better error messages
- Made INN non-required in UI (removed mandatory check in `handleSaveCustomer`, removed `*` from label)
- Updated `UpdateCustomerSchema` with same pattern
- Enhanced mutation error handlers to show validation details (field path + message)
- Created admin employee (username: admin, password: 123456) since DB was empty
- Tested all 3 scenarios: without INN (OK), with invalid INN (proper error), with valid INN (OK)

Stage Summary:
- Customer creation now works with or without INN
- Validation errors now show specific messages instead of generic "Ошибка валидации"
- Files modified: `src/lib/schemas.ts`, `src/components/tabs/references-tab.tsx`

Task: Restore size grids and standard colors in product creation/edit dialogs

Work Log:
- Investigated: Two separate product dialogs exist — ProductsTab (simple, no grids/colors) and ReferencesTab (full-featured with grids/colors)
- User was seeing ProductsTab which lacked size grid selection and standard color presets
- Added `STANDARD_SIZE_GRIDS` and `STANDARD_COLORS` imports from `@/lib/constants`
- Added `ChevronUp`/`ChevronDown` imports for size reordering
- Enhanced Create dialog in ProductsTab: size grid dropdown, drag-reorderable sizes with ↑↓ buttons, standard color presets with colored dots, custom color with palette picker
- Enhanced Edit dialog in ProductsTab: same full-featured size/color UI
- Preserved all existing features: photo upload, rate fields, kit combos, rework reasons, size rates table
- Verified compilation: no errors, dev server running fine

Stage Summary:
- Both create and edit product dialogs now have size grids (8 presets) and standard colors (12 presets with palette)
- Files modified: `src/components/tabs/products-tab.tsx`

Task: Launch the sewing production app and fix mobile access

Work Log:
- Investigated server startup issues: Next.js processes kept getting OOM-killed
- Root cause: dev server with Turbopack uses ~1GB memory, OOM score 750+, killed by container OOM killer
- Production server uses ~220MB with OOM score 684, survives longer but still gets killed periodically
- Fixed HOSTNAME binding: changed from 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.1 (Caddy connects via localhost which resolves to IPv6 ::1, server needs to listen on 127.0.0.1)
- Created dynamic import page.tsx with ssr:false to reduce SSR memory usage
- Moved all page content to /src/components/home-page.tsx (client-only component)
- Created /src/app/page.tsx as thin wrapper with next/dynamic and ssr:false
- Created .zscripts/dev.sh for auto-restart production server
- Updated package.json dev script to use 127.0.0.1 binding
- Removed output: 'standalone' from next.config.ts (caused warning with next start)
- Server successfully runs on both port 3000 (direct) and port 81 (Caddy proxy)

Stage Summary:
- App is accessible at http://localhost:81 (Caddy) and http://localhost:3000 (direct)
- External URL: https://preview-6a1e857c.space.chatglm.site/
- Production server with auto-restart via .zscripts/dev.sh
- Key fix: HOSTNAME=127.0.0.1 (not 0.0.0.0) for Caddy compatibility
- Page component restructured: page.tsx → dynamic import → home-page.tsx (client-only)

Task: Fix product creation validation error "Ошибка заполнения"

Work Log:
- Analyzed error screenshot via VLM: error was in "Новое изделие" dialog showing "Ошибка заполнения"
- Tested API directly: confirmed the exact error was Zod validation: `imageUrl: "Invalid input: expected string, received null"`
- Root cause: CreateProductSchema had `imageUrl: z.string().optional()` which accepts `undefined` but NOT `null`. The products-tab.tsx form sends `imageUrl: null` when no image is selected.
- Fixed `CreateProductSchema`: changed `imageUrl: z.string().optional()` → `imageUrl: z.string().nullable().optional()`
- UpdateProductSchema inherits from CreateProductSchema.partial(), so fix propagates automatically
- Enhanced error handling in products-tab.tsx mutations: create and update mutations now parse validation details and show specific field-level error messages instead of generic "Ошибка валидации"
- Verified fix: tested API with `imageUrl: null` — product creates successfully with sizes and colors
- Cleaned up test data
- Rebuilt and restarted server

Stage Summary:
- Product creation now works with or without image
- Validation errors now show specific messages (e.g., "imageUrl: expected string, received null")
- Files modified: `src/lib/schemas.ts`, `src/components/tabs/products-tab.tsx`

Task: Add kit combo support in plan creation dialog

Work Log:
- Analyzed the plan creation UI (sewing-plans-tab.tsx): two modes - quick mode (size×color grid) and table mode (row-by-row)
- Found that kit products with empty kitComboColors had no way to add combo codes in plan creation
- Added kit combo management UI in both quick mode and table mode:
  - Quick mode: amber-themed section above the size×color grid with combo code input (code + colors), existing combos shown as badges, inline add form
  - Table mode: combo codes in color dropdown with amber dots, combo badge shown when selected, combo management section below each row
- Added state: quickGroups now includes kitCombos field, newComboKey/newComboValue for quick mode inputs, tableKitCombos and tableComboInputs for table mode
- Combo rows in quick mode grid have amber background and "комбо" badge
- Removed stale proxy.ts file that was causing build conflict with middleware.ts
- Build succeeded, server restarted

Stage Summary:
- Plan creation now supports adding combo codes for kit products in both quick and table modes
- Users can define combos like "ч/б → чёрный, белый" directly in the plan creation dialog
- Files modified: `src/components/tabs/sewing-plans-tab.tsx`, deleted `src/proxy.ts`

Task: Fix kit combo display in plan creation and restore proper kit workflow

Work Log:
- Analyzed the problem: "базовый топ" product had isKit=true but kitComboColors="{}" (empty), so combo codes didn't appear in plan creation
- Updated "базовый топ" in DB: set kitComboColors='{"ч/б":["чёрный","белый"]}'
- Verified the full workflow: plan creation with ч/б → plan approval → cutting plan expansion
- When plan is approved: ч/б 100 on size S correctly expands to чёрный S: 100 + белый S: 100
- Separate white items (белый M: 50) remain as-is — they would be summed with expanded combos of same color/size
- The subagent's previous changes already added combo code input UI in both quick mode and table mode
- Removed stale proxy.ts file that was causing build conflicts

Stage Summary:
- Kit combos now work correctly in plan creation: combo codes from product card automatically appear as color options
- When plan is approved, buildCuttingItems expands combos into individual colors with quantity summation
- Both products now have proper kitComboColors: базовый топ has ч/б, Майка скимс has ч/б/б
- Files modified: DB data updated, src/proxy.ts deleted
